# Introduction

Are you ever bored of the Default VScode Theme and Look? <br>
We have different theme and icon pack extensions to customise the look of our VScode. But if that's not enough, You want something more, if you want to change the VScode look more in depth (_like: change the font, change the size of the scroll bar, remove unnessery clutters that you never use..._) then you are in the Right Place.

# Customise VScode
## Basic Set up

> First Download **Aura Dracula Spirit** Theme and **helium-icon-theme** icon pack Extentions

1. Step 1: Open user settings json file of Vscode named `settings.json` inside vscode
1. Step 2: Paste the code from `settings.json` file of this Repo

These are my personal preferences but you can always modify it as you please and take guidance from the videos I took inspirations from.

## Set up Custom CSS

> Install **Custom CSS and JS Loader** Extension first

1. Step 1: Create a custom css file named `custom_vscode.css` at _file:///C:/Users/User/.vscode/_ path
1. Step 2: Paste the code from `custom_vscode.css` file of this Repo

This set up is for windows, for other users just create your own css file and paste the code from here and change the Path of the Custom CSS File in the `settings.json` file inside `vscode_custom_css.imports` property.

Or

1. Step 1: Make your own customised css file
1. Step 2: Link the path of that file in the `settings.json` file inside `vscode_custom_css.imports` property

> Don't forget to enable the Extension and Reload VScode to see the changes

Because we added our `custom_vscode.css` file inside `.vscode` folder, You might see Code Corrupt warning or pop up after launching VScode, Just ignore it and set it not to warn again.
