# Basic Set up

Open user settings json file of VsCode named `settings.json`
Paste the code of `settings.json` file

These are my preferences but you can always modify it as you please and take guidance from the videos I took inspirations from.

# Custom CSS

> Install Custom CSS and JS Loader Extension first

Create a custom css file named `custom_vscode.css` at _file:///C:/Users/Dell/.vscode/_ path
Paste the `custom_vscode.css` file's code in it.

Or

Make your own customised css file
Link the path of that file in the `settings.json` file inside `vscode_custom_css.imports` property

> Don't forget to enable the Extension and Reload the VScode to see the changes
