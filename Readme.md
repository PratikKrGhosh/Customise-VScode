# Basic Set up

1. Open user settings json file of VsCode named `settings.json`
1. Paste the code of `settings.json` file

[!NOTE] These are my personal preferences but you can always modify it as you please and take guidance from the videos I took inspirations from.

# Custom CSS

> Install Custom CSS and JS Loader Extension first

1. Create a custom css file named `custom_vscode.css` at _file:///C:/Users/Dell/.vscode/_ path
1. Paste the `custom_vscode.css` file's code in it.

Or

1. Make your own customised css file
1. Link the path of that file in the `settings.json` file inside `vscode_custom_css.imports` property

> Don't forget to enable the Extension and Reload the VScode to see the changes

[! IMPORTANT] > Because we added our `custom_vscode.css` file inside `.vscode` folder, You might see Code Corrupt warning or pop up after launching VScode, Just ignore it and set it not to warn again
